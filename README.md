# CPSC-8650 Data Mining Project: Predicting Hearing Loss from MRI Data

## Project Overview
This project explores machine learning techniques to predict hearing loss thresholds using 3D images of the brain's gray matter. Developed at Clemson University by Trinath Sai Subhash Reddy Pittala, Uma Maheswara R Meleti, and Manasa Thatipamula, this work leverages advanced models like autoencoders, variational autoencoders, and multi-layer neural networks to approach the complex relationship between neuroanatomy and auditory function.

## Folder Structure
- `code/` - All the project scripts and model training files.
- `data/` - Dataset directory containing MRI images and hearing threshold labels.
- `docs/` - Documentation and project report PDF along with results and analysis.

## Models
We utilized several machine learning models:
- **Autoencoders** for dimensionality reduction.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** to capture complex, non-linear relationships within the data.
- **Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MNN)** for regression analysis.

Note: This repo is not fully directory optimised so you may have to change folder structure in the code to run the scripts.
